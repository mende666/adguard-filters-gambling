# Gambling Site Filters for AdGuard & uBlock

This folder contains a custom filter list for AdGuard, uBlock Origin, and other compatible ad blockers. The list is designed to block, hide, or remove elements related to gambling websites, including banners, popups, announcements, and site-specific content.

## Purpose

- Create a more focused browsing experience by cleaning up the user interface
- Get rid of announcements, information banners, and floating or sticky elements

## Scope

- Online casinos
- Poker sites

## Usage

2. **Import** the file into your ad blocker:
   - **AdGuard:** Go to Settings → Content Blocking → Custom Filters → Add filter.
   - **uBlock Origin:** Go to Dashboard → Filter lists → Custom → Add the filter URL or upload the file.
3. **Enable** the filter and refresh your browser.
