# AdGuard Gambling Filter

My first blocklist—targeting sites with pop-ups so bad they deserve their own horror category.

This tool cleans up the user interface by removing distracting and unnecessary elements. It specifically targets and removes:

- **Pop-ups and Banners:** Gets rid of site-wide announcements, information banners, and other floating or sticky elements.
- **Advertisements:** Eliminates embedded videos, promotional call-to-action buttons, and other advertisements.
- **UI Clutter:** Hides scrolling text, cleans up inactive interface elements, and removes social media links, creating a cleaner and more focused Browse experience.

## Features

- Blocks gambling pop-ups, icons, and widgets.
- Targets aggressive advertising on gambling sites.
- Designed for AdGuard Chrome extension and app.
