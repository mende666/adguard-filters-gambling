**Gambling Site Filters** _for_ **AdGuard Chrome**

_My first_ **blocklist**_â€”targeting_ **sites** _with_ **pop-ups** _so bad they deserve their own horror category._

_This tool cleans up the user interface by removing distracting and unnecessary elements. It specifically targets and removes:_

* **Pop-ups and Banners:** _Gets rid of site-wide announcements, information banners, and other floating or sticky elements._
* **Advertisements:** _Eliminates embedded videos, promotional call-to-action buttons, and other advertisements._
* **UI Clutter:** _Hides scrolling text, cleans up inactive interface elements, and removes social media links, creating a cleaner and more focused Browse experience._
